# üêæ Motion Detector Using Arduino Uno

A simple and effective motion detector to sense the presence of dangerous animals nearby using a **PIR sensor**, **Piezo buzzer**, and **LED** connected to an **Arduino Uno**.  

This system works by detecting infrared radiation emitted by warm-blooded animals and immediately alerts nearby people using visual (LED) and auditory (buzzer) signals. It is designed to be **low-cost, portable, and easy-to-use**, ideal for areas prone to animal encounters.
