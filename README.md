# Motion-detector-using-Arduino-Uno
This project presents a motion detector to sense dangerous animalsâ€™ presence nearby using a PIR sensor combined with a Piezo buzzer and LED connected to an Arduino Uno. The sensor operates through IR sensing (warm-blooded animals) to alert people of the presence of animals nearby. It is to be used as a simplistic, cheap and easy-to-carry warning device in areas prone to animal attacks.
The file Design shows the electrical connections in Tinkercad to assemble this project.
The file Code shows the code for this project.
Above all, this is a simple mini project to demonstrate the use of motion sensing using IR and buzzer addition.
